# 🦀🔥 Rustorch

**From raw bytes to recognized digits: A pure Rust MNIST implementation.**

Rustorch is a lightweight, from-scratch machine learning project exploring the foundations of neural networks in Rust. It ditches heavy ML frameworks to handle memory management, matrix math, and binary parsing manually.

### ⚡ Features
* **No ML Frameworks:** Implements tensors and math from first principles.
* **Raw I/O:** Custom parsers for `.mat` and binary dataset files.
* **Terminal Viz:** Renders MNIST digits directly in the console using ANSI color codes.
